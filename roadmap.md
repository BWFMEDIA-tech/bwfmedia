# Roadmap

## Mobile push notifications
- [ ] Reuse inbox, device subscription storage and PWA; secure VAPID delivery with opt-in settings
- [ ] Integrate challenges, messages, followers, followed-artist uploads and authorized event announcements
- [ ] Verify delivery security, preferences, duplicate prevention and mobile settings
- [ ] Publish and verify closed-app delivery on real iPhone (iOS 16.4+) and Android devices — requires devices

## Artist 1v1 Challenge Queue & Host Battle Management (uploaded spec)
